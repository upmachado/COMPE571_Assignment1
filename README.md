COMPE 571 Assignment 1
========
#### Baseline.c file corresponds to Case 1: Baseline
The code has loops iterating through N values. If you do not want to run through each N value, remove the unwanted value from the array and decrement the corresponding iteration value.
#### Multithread.c file file corresponds to Case 2: Multithread
Need to manually change N value and NUM_THREAD value for different scenerios
#### Multitasking.c file file corresponds to Case 3: Multitasking with fork
The code has loops iterating through N values and NUM_TASKS. If you do not want to run through each N value and NUM_TASKS, remove the unwanted value from the array and decrement the corresponding iteration value.
#### Multitasking_Opt2 file corresponds to Case 3 Option 2: Multitasking with popen. 
Run with Baseline_Opt2. The code has loops iterating through N values and NUM_TASKS. If you do not want to run through each N value and NUM_TASKS, remove the unwanted value from the array and decrement the corresponding iteration value.
